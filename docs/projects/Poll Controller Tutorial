# Poll Controller   

## Step 1: Setup radio signal
We want to send a signal from one micro:bit to another using the radio function. 
Drag ``||radio:radio set group||`` into ``||basic:on start||``.
Change the radio set group number to 4.
Delete the ``||basic:forever||`` block by dragging it onto the toolbox on the left side of the workspace until a garbage icon appears.

## Step 2: Identify our micro:bit
We need to let the receiving micro:bit identify who they are receiving data from.
Drag ``||radio:radio set transmit serial number||`` into ``||basic:on start||``.
Ensure it is set to "true".
    
## Step 3: Maintain the radio connection
Now we want the micro:bit to continuously transmit this data to maintain the connection.
Drag ``||loops:every (500)ms||`` onto the workspace and set it to 40000ms.
Drag ``||radio:radio set transmit serial number||`` into ``||loops:every (40000)ms||``.

## Step 4: Setup a button
Now let's setup what our buttons will do.
Drag ``||input:on button [A] pressed||`` onto the workspace.
We need the button to trigger a radio signal. 
Drag ``||radio:radio send string []||`` into ``||input:on button [A] pressed||`` and set it to "A".

## Step 5: Create a led icon
We want our LED array to reflect our button press. 
Drag ``||basic:show leds||`` into ``||input:on button [A] pressed||`` under ``||radio:radio send string [A]||``.
Select the leds you want it to show to represent the letter "A".

## Step 6: Setup the next button
Now repeat steps 4 and 5, changing ``||input:on button [A] pressed||`` to "B" and ``||basic:show leds||`` to represent the letter "B".

## Step 7: Setup the third button
Drag ``||input:on logo [pressed]||`` onto the workspace.
Drag ``||radio:radio send string []||`` into ``||input:on logo [pressed]||`` and set it to "C".
Drag ``||basic:show leds||`` underneath ``||radio:radio send string [C]||`` and select the leds to represent the letter "C".

## Step 8: Setup the final "button"
Our final trigger will be a "reset" using the shake function.
Drag ``||input:on [shake]||`` onto the workspace.
Drag ``||radio:radio send string []||`` into ``||input:on [shake]||`` and set it to "D".
Drag ``||basic:show icon []||`` underneath ``||radio:radio send string [D]||`` and select the icon of your choice.

## Step 9: Finalize
Connect your micro:bit and click "Download" to install the program.
