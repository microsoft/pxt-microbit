# Bluetooth Tests

## Test preparations

Four hex files needed:
- "Meet the micro:bit": This is the programme that runs on the micro:bit when
  it is first powered on from factory.
    - Downloadable from the micro:bit website:
      https://microbit.org/get-started/user-guide/meet-the-microbit-program/
- "Out of Box": The previous factory programme before the
  "Meet the micro:bit" was released.
    - Downloadable from the micro:bit website:
      https://microbit.org/get-started/user-guide/meet-the-microbit-program/
- MakeCode Live Editor hex file: To ensure micro:bits with a recent MakeCode
  project can be flashed via Bluetooth with the MakeCode editor under test.
    - Create a hex file from the latest MakeCode live editor:
      https://makecode.microbit.org/
- Python Editor hex file: To ensure the MakeCode editor under test can
  BLE flash micro:bits after using the Python Editor.
    - Go to https://python.microbit.org and download the hex file
      with the default project.
    - This hex file can only be tested with micro:bit V2
- MakeCode Under Test hex file: To ensure it can be flashed over.

Two mobile/tablet devices needed:
- Android device with the micro:bit app installed.
    - To load a custom MakeCode URL long touch the micro:bit logo in the app
      main screen. A modal will appear with the option change the MakeCode URL.
    - This URL setting will be reset every time the app is quit
- iOS device with the micro:bit app installed.
    - To load a different MakeCode version, long press the MakeCode back
      chevron to choose beta.
    - The iOS app can only choose between beta and live.

Two micro:bits needed:
- micro:bit V1
- micro:bit V2

The micro:bits can be powered via USB for these tests, as that avoids any
possible issues or errors due to low batteries.

## Test 1: Full & partial flashing with Bluetooth

This test should be carried out with:
- Android app
- iOS app

And the following micro:bit versions:
- micro:bit V1
- micro:bit V2

A test run for each of these hex files is required:
- "Out of Box" hex file
- "Meet the micro:bit" hex file
- MakeCode Live Editor hex file
- Python Editor hex file (micro:bit V2 only)
- MakeCode Under Test hex file

Steps:
1. Connect the micro:bit to the computer via USB.
2. Copy the hex file under test to the `MICROBIT` USB drive.
3. Remove the previous micro:bit pairing from the iOS or Android device.
4. Open the micro:bit app and load the MakeCode editor under test.
    - From the front page, select "Create Code"
    - Click on the cog, and the "About" menu entry, check the MakeCode version
      in this modal
5. Create a new MakeCode project with a simple programme (e.g. display
   something on the LED matrix).
    - If a programme has already been created from a previous test run,
      it can be reused.
6. Tap the "Download" button and use "My pattern is different" to force pairing,
   then follow the instruction to flash the programme.
7. Verify the programme is running on the micro:bit.
8. Change the blocks in the MakeCode editor to do something different
   (e.g. display a different icon/message on the LED matrix).
9. Tap the "Download" button and follow the instructions to flash the programme.
10. Confirm the BLE flashing process was shorter than the initial download from
   step 5.
11. Verify that the new programme is running on the micro:bit.

## Test 2: Utility Service

This test checks that the Utility Service is available and working on
the builds of the MakeCode editor under test.

This test should be carried out with:
- Android app
- iOS app

And the following micro:bit versions:
- micro:bit V2 only

Steps:
1. Flash the micro:bit with this programme usin the MakeCode Under Test.
   This project needs the datalogger extension to be added.
   Ensure this project does not have the Bluetooth extension.
   The board can be flashed using any method.
    ```javascript
    basic.forever(function () {
        datalogger.log(
        datalogger.createCV("y", input.acceleration(Dimension.Y)),
        datalogger.createCV("x", input.acceleration(Dimension.X))
        )
        basic.pause(100)
    })
    ```
2. Open the micro:bit app, go to "My Programs".
3. Tap on the "Fetch MY_DATA (V2 only)" button and follow the instructions
   to connect the micro:bit via Bluetooth.
4. Verify that the data as a table of Time, X and Y acceleration values
   is shown in the app.
5. Add the Bluetooth extension to the project and flash the micro:bit again.
6. Back to the app main menu, tap on the "Pair" button to pair the micro:bit.
    - A WebUSB flash would have deleted the previous pair.
7. Press the reset button on the micro:bit to ensure the programme is running.
8. Back to the app main menu, go to "My Programs" and tap on the
   "Fetch MY_DATA (V2 only)" button.
9. In the "Fecth MY_DATA" screen, select "During Logging" at the top and
   tap the "Fetch" button.
10. Verify data is displayed and the fetch has not failed.
